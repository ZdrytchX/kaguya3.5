This is just a modified script for people who can't access the 'Kaguya-sama: Geniuses' War of Love' manga series when not available in their country in English (e.g. Western Australia) and to read ahead of the licensed editions. According to MAL the series is licensed by VIZ Media in the U.S. so unless you are reading in advance, Americans should be purchasing the original volumes.


This script is adapted for Python 3.5/3.6 (Original script was for Python 2.7). You can get python 3.6 at https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/. To run, right click and run under IDLE and press F5, or drag the python script into the python shell window, or double click the file depending on how you set up python.


This script is Modified by two or three different people for Python 3.5/3.6. The original script (found on a Bato.to forum post) for Python 2.7 and basic DMCA info is here:
