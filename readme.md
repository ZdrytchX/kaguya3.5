This is just a modified script for people who can't access the 'Kaguya-sama: Geniuses' War of Love' manga series when not available in their country in English (e.g. Australia)(and even so, I couldn't find any licensed version information suggesting that it hasn't been translated officially). Adapted for Python 3.5/3.6 (Original script was for Python 2.7)

This script is Modified by two or three different people for Python 3.5/3.6. The original script (found on a Bato.to forum post) for Python 2.7 and basic DMCA info is here:
